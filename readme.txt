== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will it count post views for every post/custom post types? =
No, it will not. The plugin only counts post views for the selected post types that you enable in the admin area. This helps reduce database/server load. In the free version, only 'post' is available. In the PRO version, you can enable multiple post types.

= Will it count the post view on every single visit of the user? =
Yes, but the plugin includes settings in the admin area to control and limit view counting behavior.

= Will it work for custom post types too? =
In the free version, only the default 'post' type is supported. The PRO version supports custom post types.
